# CheckWord2Vec_CBOW
This code is to check pretrained Word2Vec CBOW.

The word vectors are pretrained with:

vector_dimentions=300, sliding_window_size=5, min_count=2, iteration=100, hs=1

You can run this code on google colab or on your pc. To run on google colap:

Download two files (w2v_cbow.wv and w2v_cbow.wv.vectors.npy) from the following links:
